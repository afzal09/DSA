# Compact Arrays

Compact Arrays are used to store the bits that represent the primary data
Compact Array provide high performance computing by storing Primary data consecutively in memory 

this is not the case for refferential structure, i.e even though a List maintains carefull ordering of the sequence of memory address where those elements reside in memory in not determined by the List

Support for Compact Array is in module named Array, which contains class named Array
providing compact structure for arrays of primitive data types
